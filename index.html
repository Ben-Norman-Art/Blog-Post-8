<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">For the Final Project me and my partner, Brian Ressler, decided to continue with our game prototype, Knighthood. With the continuing the game it was easy to figure out with all the needed updates that would improve the game as well as make the game run more smoothly. We focused on most of the feedback we received from the game sessions that occurred but still decided to stick with some of the original assets and concepts. As the artist and designer, I thought it would be beneficial for the game and the narrative of the game to add two more levels. I drafted multiple different designs for the levels and got my partnerâ€™s feedback, whether or not the levels were decent to produce. My partner being the producer as well as the programmer believed that adding title screens as well as death and win screens can help the game more.

One aspect that was very common with the game was adding a sword and swing feature to the game in order for the players to be able to defend and attack the enemies within the game. Which me and my partner decided would be a good idea to include and move forward with it. With this it was difficult deciding how to structure the enemies in the game in order for the players to use them. A lot of feedback consisted of not having the enemy slimes not grab onto the players thus resulting in an attack action within the mechanics. Me and my partner still decided to keep the enemy slimes the way that they were due to the difficulty that proceeded within the gameplay. Overall, this was a very fun game to help create and I would have to give Brian a big thank you for the amount of time he has put up with especially during his last semester here.
